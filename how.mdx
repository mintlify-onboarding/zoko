### Building a Webhook

A webhook ends up looking like an API call, but in reverse. Rather than you calling the API and requesting data, the API is calling you to let you know something has happened. All services will require at least one thing: the URL, or endpoint, to send the payload to. 

If you've ever built a REST API that your application or other apps use, you know nearly everything you need to get started.

Here is a [sample code](https://bitbucket.org/zokoee/demos/src/master/webhooks-generic/) to get your started

### How to register a Webhook?

Once you have built your webhook handler, you need to register it with Zoko to receive notifications
