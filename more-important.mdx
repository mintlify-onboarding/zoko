title: "Key Considerations"
---

Hopefully, by now, you would have created atleast one webhook and processed your messages. Let's get to some minor things that could cause unwarranted issues later.  
  
  
### Return a 200 status code quickly

Zoko webhook expects a response from your callback endpoint as an acknowledgement of the message. 

Expected Response : **HTTP 200 OK**  
Response within : **5 seconds**

_Please note if either of them doesn't happen, it's treated as a message delivery failure and retry logic will be executed_

### Retry logic

Zoko attempts to deliver your webhooks for up to **5** times with an exponential back off. 

If your endpoint has been deleted when we attempt a retry, future retries of that event will be prevented. However, if it was failing to return a success message (on time) you should still expect to see future retry attempts.  
  
  
### Disable Logic

Zoko will attempt to notify you of a misconfigured endpoint via email if an endpoint has not responded with a 200 HTTP status code for multiple times in a row. 

After **6** consecutive failures, the webhook will be disabled.
